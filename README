opaque: a blog written in OPA

Currently posix only.

BUILDING
 make

Then you can run it with:
 make run

Or:
 make cloud OPTS=...

where 'OPTS' are the options you would normally give to opa-cloud. By
default it just launches two instances on localhost. Make sure your
own ssh public key is in your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Admin password will be generated on the first run, and output to
server debug console.
